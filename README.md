# Emotion Detection and Summarization

## Overview

This project implements an application to detect and summarize emotions from both video and audio content. By integrating machine learning models, the application analyzes visual and auditory cues, providing comprehensive emotional insights for sentiment analysis and content recommendation.

## Features

- Emotion detection from video and audio inputs.
- Summarization of detected emotions for better understanding and analysis.
- Machine learning models trained to recognize various emotional states.

## File Structure
Emotion-Detection-and-Summarization/ │ ├── app.py # Main application script ├── model.h5 # Trained model for emotion detection └── speech-emotion-recognition.ipynb # Jupyter notebook for speech emotion recognition


Usage
Run the Application: Start the application by executing the following command:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Input: Upload video or audio files to analyze emotions.

Output: The application will display the detected emotions and provide a summary of the results.

Jupyter Notebook
The speech-emotion-recognition.ipynb notebook contains the implementation of the speech emotion recognition model. You can run the notebook to explore the model training process, data preprocessing, and emotion detection techniques.

Model
The model.h5 file contains the trained model for emotion detection. It was developed using a variety of datasets to ensure accuracy across different emotional states.
